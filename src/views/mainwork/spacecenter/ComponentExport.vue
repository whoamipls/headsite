        <p class="hdPara">随着中国在航天领域综合实力和技术能力的大幅提升，中国宇航产品也获得世界客户的青睐。 “技术成熟、可靠性高、性价比好” 是中国宇航级产品的三大优势，得到欧洲主流宇航企业的关注及认可。和德宇航公司作为中国首批商业航天公司之一，13年来密切关注国际商业航天动态，为中国宇航产品出口发挥积极作用。已成功将国内的星敏、太敏、热控薄膜、太阳能电池片等产品出口至瑞士、意大利、南非等国家。</p>
        <p class="hdPara hdPMT">With the substantial improvement of China's space comprehensive strength and technological capability, Chinese space products have an emerging presence in the international space market.</p>
        <p class="hdPara hdPMT">"Mature technology, high reliability and good cost performance" are the three advantages of China's space products, which have drawn the attention and recognition of mainstream space enterprises. The products ranges from EPS, solar panels, OBC, TTC, ADCS, structures, composite materials, etc. Founded in 2007, we’ve built a strong partnership with Chinese manufacturers and serve as an authorized distribution partner and in many cases the exclusive distribution partner for the international markets.

        <p class="hdHead1 hdH1MT hdIconRect">M2离子推进器 M2-ion thruster</p>
        <p class="hdPara">For 20kg satellites, M2-type low-power microwave ion thruster has the advantages of low power consumption, light weight, high specific impulse, reliable operation and easy use. The maximum thrust is 0.5Mn; the specific impulse is better than 1000s; the total system weight is less than 3.2kg; the total impulse is more than 4400s; and the total system power consumption is less than 45W (when thrust is 0.5mN). At present, the M2 low-power microwave ion thruster is a leading high-performance ion propulsion system designed for satellites with power consumption less than 50W.</p>
        <p class="hdHead1 hdH1MT">产品介绍 Product introduction</p>
        <p class="hdPara">The effective beam diameter of M2 ion thruster is 2cm. It adopts microwave ionization principle and dual-gate ion optical system. It has the advantages of simple structure, reliable operation, convenient operation, and wide range of adjustment of working state.</p> 
        <p class="hdPara hdPMT">The maximum thrust is 0.5Mn; the power is less than 45W; the specific impulse exceeds 1100 s; Rated thrust 0.3mN with power less than 35W; When the thrust requirement is less than 0.3mN, the total power consumption of the propulsion system is less than 30W. The thruster has high reliability, 6000h life test has been completed and its performance is stable. Its integrated performance index is in the first class among the small power ion thrusters at home and abroad.</p>
        <p class="hdPara hdPMT">The thruster uses a double-surplus, cold backup heater-cathode neutralizer, with a heating power consumption of only 6W and a service life exceeding 5000h. Two heater-cathodes backup can ensure the reliability of the thruster.</p>
